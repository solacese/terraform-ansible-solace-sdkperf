# ansible/inventory

Ansible inventory files will automatically be generated by Terraform on this directory. 

Terraform will automatically trigger the BOOTSTRAP Ansible Task for the SDKPerf Nodes & Solace Brokers, but custom ansible playbooks triggered manually that run SDKPerf commands can also target these inventory files.
