GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

Version 2, June 1991

Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is
 numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]
Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By
contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and
change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some specially designated Free
Software Foundation software, and to any other libraries whose authors decide to use it. You can
use it for your libraries, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses
are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and
charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,
that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you
can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or
to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give
the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can
get the source code. If you link a program with the library, you must provide complete object files
to the recipients so that they can relink them with the library, after making changes to the
library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright the library, and (2) offer you
this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain that everyone understands that
there is no warranty for this free library. If the library is modified by someone else and passed
on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original version, so that any
problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger
that companies distributing free software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect
transforming the program into proprietary software. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License,
which was designed for utility programs. This license, the GNU Library General Public License,
applies to certain designated libraries. This license is quite different from the ordinary one; be
sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is the same as in the ordinary
license.

The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that they blur the distinction
we usually make between modifying or adding to a program and simply using it. Linking a program
with a library, without changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is
analogous to running a utility program or application program. However, in a textual and legal
sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a derivative of the original library, and the
ordinary General Public License treats it as such.

Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General Public License for libraries did
not effectively promote software sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries. We
concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.

However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the users of those programs of all
benefit from the free status of the libraries themselves. This Library General Public License is
intended to permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while preserving your
freedom as a user of such programs to change the free libraries that are incorporated in them. (We
have not seen how to achieve this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as
regards changes in the actual functions of the Library.) The hope is that this will lead to faster
development of free libraries.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close
attention to the difference between a "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the
library". The former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only works together
with the library.

Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary General Public License rather
than by this special one.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which contains a notice placed by the
copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this
Library General Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".

A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently
linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under
these terms. A "work based on the Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or
with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter,
translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)

"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a
library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and
installation of the library.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they
are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output
from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library
(independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on
what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive
it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with
the Library.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer
warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work
based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section
1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files
and the date of any change.
c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the
terms of this License.
d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by
an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does
not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its
purpose remains meaningful.
(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely
well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application
does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are
not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute
them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a
work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License,
whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part
regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written
entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
derivative or collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a
work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other
work under the scope of this License.

3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this
License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to
this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of
to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has
appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in
these notices.

Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU
General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is
not a library.

4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in
object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you
accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software
interchange.

If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then
offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along
with the object code.

5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work
with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".
Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the
scope of this License.

However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an executable that is a
derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that
uses the library". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for
distribution of such executables.

When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library,
the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is
not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library,
or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by
law.

If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and
small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables
containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)

Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the
work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or link a "work that uses the
Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that
work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the
customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.

You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that
the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the
work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the
Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also,
you must do one of these things:

a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library
including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2
above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete
machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the user
can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified
Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)
b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user
the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing
this distribution.
c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer
equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.
d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already
sent this user a copy.
For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must include any data and
utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception,
the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either
source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating
system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary
libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you
cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.

7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single
library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a
combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of
the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined
with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.
b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on
the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly
provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have
their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else
grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions
are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing
the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do
so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works
based on it.

10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient
automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or
modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for
enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.

11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other
reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from
the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your
obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free
redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,
then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance,
the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in
other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right
claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting
the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license
practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the
author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and
a licensee cannot impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest
of this License.

12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by
patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under
this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so
that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this
License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Library General
Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present
version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of
this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the
terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version
ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution
conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software
which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the
free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of
software generally.

NO WARRANTY

15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.
SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
CORRECTION.

16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT
HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA
OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE
LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we
recommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by
permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary
General Public License).

To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest to attach them to
the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file
should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.
Copyright (C) year  name of author

This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public
License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
Library General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public
License along with this library; if not, write to the
Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor,
Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA.
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a
"copyright disclaimer" for the library, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in
the library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written

to Licensee a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable (except as permitted in 
accordance with Section 2.6 below), non-transferable, license, during the 
term of this Agreement, to install and use the Software in object code form

accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 
 
(b)	If Licensee requires a license from SOLACE to enable Licensee to 
bundle or otherwise make available a Product with Licensee’s own software, 
such bundling will be pursuant to separate terms to be agreed.	

2.2	Documentation. Provided Licensee complies with this Agreement, 
Licensee may reproduce the Documentation, for use on an internal basis only, 
and solely in support of the Licensee’s licensed use of the Software. 
Distribution of the Documentation outside of Licensee is prohibited without 
the express written permission of SOLACE. Licensee must reproduce all 
copyright and other proprietary notices that are on the original copy of the 
Documentation.

2.3	Back-up Copy.  In addition to the number of copies of the Software 
installed and used pursuant to Section 2.1 and paid for in accordance with 
Section 5, Licensee may make one copy of each licensed Product per 
Subscription solely for back-up purposes, provided that Licensee reproduces 
all copyright and other proprietary notices that are on the original copy of 
the Software and such back-up copy is not installed or used other than for 
back-up and recovery purposes.	Back-up copies that are used as part of a 
live or ‘hot’ back-up will be subject to additional fees.

2.4	Use Restrictions.  Licensee will not: (a) reverse engineer, 
disassemble, decompile, or translate the Software (other than Sample 
Applications), or otherwise attempt to derive the source code version of the 
Software, except if and only to the extent expressly permitted by applicable 
law, and provided that Licensee first approaches SOLACE and seeks permission 
in writing; (b) except as expressly permitted in this Agreement, use the 
Products or any portion thereof to create or develop any developer tools

2.5	Publicly Available Software. Portions of the Software include 
software programs that are distributed by SOLACE pursuant to the terms and 
conditions of a license granted by the copyright owner of such software 
programs and which governs Customer’s use of such software programs 
("Publicly Available Software").  The Licensee’s use of Publicly Available 
Software in conjunction with the Software in a manner consistent with the 
terms of this Agreement is permitted, however, the Licensee may have broader 
rights under the applicable license for Publicly Available Software and 
nothing contained herein is intended to impose restrictions or limitations on 
the Licensee’s use of the Publicly Available Software. The warranty, 
indemnity and limitation of liability provisions in this Agreement will apply 
to all of the Software, including Publicly Available Software included in the 
Software. Copies of such Publicly Available Software license agreements are 
available by contacting Licensor at support@solace.com. The source code for 
certain portions of the Publicly Available Software included in the Software

transfer the Products to a third party in breach of this restriction will be 
void.  Any sub-licensing that may be permitted under this Agreement by SOLACE 
will be subject to such sub-licensee agreeing to substantially similar 
restrictions and obligations set out in this Agreement.  Licensee will be 
fully liable for any breach by a sub-licensee of any restriction or 
obligation, and SOLACE may bring a Claim against Licensee if SOLACE suffers 
any Losses arising from such breach.

2.7	Evaluation Licenses.  

(a)	If the Software provided to Licensee under this Agreement is 
designated by SOLACE in an Order or otherwise as an evaluation release 
(indicated by terms such as "pre-commercial", "alpha," "beta," "trial," 
"draft," "early access," "EA" or "evaluation") (each an "Evaluation Software 
Release"), Licensee will have the limited right under this Agreement to 
download and install the Software on the number of Cores identified in the 
Order or, if not identified, one Core, for the Licensee’s internal and 
non-commercial evaluation of the Software.
  
(b)	Licensee acknowledges that the Evaluation Software Release may not 
meet performance and compatibility standards of a production version. The 
Evaluation Software Release may not operate correctly, may be substantially 
modified by SOLACE prior to first commercial shipment, and may be withdrawn 
completely and never issued for commercial use.  

(c)	If Licensee desires other rights for the Evaluation Software Release, 
Licensee must request from SOLACE a commercial release of the Software. 
 
(d)	The limited use license granted in subsection (a) will automatically 
expire on the earlier of: (i) the date when the Software is made available to 
Licensee as a commercially available product, and (ii) the date specified in 
the Order or, if no such date is identified in the Order, the date that is 30 
days after the date of delivery or provision of the Evaluation Software 
Release to Licensee. Following license expiry Licensee will permanently 
delete or otherwise purge such Evaluation Software Release from Licensee’s 
systems and, if requested by SOLACE, certify the same. 

2.8	License of APIs. Provided Licensee complies with this Agreement and 
any terms that SOLACE provides, SOLACE grants to Licensee a non-exclusive, 
royalty free license, during the term of this Agreement, to download, install 
and use, the applicable application programming interfaces that may be made 
available by SOLACE with the Software ("APIs") solely to create interfaces 
between the Software and the Licensee’s software or third party software on 
Licensee’s systems. 

2.9	License to Sample Applications.  

(a)	SOLACE may, in its sole discretion, provide certain sample Software 
in source code or object code form for the purposes of demonstrating certain 
features enabled by the Software, including demonstrating to Licensees how to 
build applications using APIs, and for use by Licensees with such APIs (each, 
a "Sample Application").

(b)	Whether provided separately or together with other Software, if 
SOLACE provides such Sample Application to Licensee, then SOLACE hereby 
grants to Licensee a non-sublicensable, non-transferable, non-exclusive, 
revocable license, to install such Sample Application for Licensee’s 
evaluation for the same duration as the Software with which the Sample 
Application is associated or such other duration as specified by SOLACE upon 
delivery of the Sample Application.

3	OPTIONAL SERVICES AND SUPPORT

3.1	Optional Services.  Licensee acknowledge that certain optional 
services, such as training, integration and development services may be 
provided by SOLACE in association with the Products, and access to such 
services will be provided only pursuant to a Statement of Work executed by 
SOLACE and Licensee and may include separate and additional fees.

3.2	Support. 

(a)	Provided Licensee complies with this Agreement, SOLACE will provide 
Support and Maintenance Services the Software in accordance with SOLACE’s 
then standard Support and Maintenance Terms.  The level of support will be 
dependent on whether Licensee has procured either the ‘Premium Support Plan’ 
or ‘Standard Support Plan’ defined in SOLACE’s Support and Maintenance Terms 
and as specified in the applicable Order.  

(b)	SOLACE may enhance such standard Support and Maintenance Services 
from time to time in its discretion. 

(c)	For greater clarity, SOLACE’s then standard Support and Maintenance 
Terms do not apply to Evaluation Software Releases, Sample Applications or 
any free versions of the Software that may be made available.  SOLACE may 
make available support related information on a free basis for such Software 
on its publicly accessible website or otherwise, and such support related 
information will, for greater clarity, be subject to the limitations and 
exclusions in this Agreement.

4	PROPRIETARY RIGHTS

4.1	Intellectual Property Rights.  In this Agreement "Intellectual 
Property Rights" means: (a) any and all proprietary rights anywhere in the 
world provided under: (i) patent law; (ii) copyright law (including moral 
rights); (iii) trademark law; (iv) design patent or industrial design law; or 
(v) any other statutory provision or common law principle applicable to this

sub-licenses, franchises, agreements or any other evidence of a right in any 
of the foregoing.  Except for the licenses expressly granted herein, othing

provides to Licensee title, interest or any Intellectual Property Rights in 
or to: (a) the Products, or (b) know-how, ideas, or any other subject matter 
protectable under laws applicable to Intellectual Property Rights of any 
jurisdiction. As between Licensee and SOLACE, SOLACE and its affiliates and 
licensors are the sole and exclusive owners of the Products, including 
Intellectual Property Rights therein. 

4.2	Feedback.  Licensee is encouraged to provide to SOLACE suggestions, 
comments and feedback related to the Products (including reporting bugs) (the 
"Feedback"). Licensee hereby grants to SOLACE a license to use, copy, 
distribute, modify or otherwise adapt, incorporate into any software and 
documentation, including the Products, and sublicense, without attribution or 
compensation to Licensee, all Feedback which SOLACE receives or otherwise 
obtains from Licensee, in any form, to improve, enhance or modify the 
Products or otherwise.	Licensee waives or will cause all moral rights to be 
waived in any Feedback.

4.3	Third Party Licenses.  The Software may contain or require third 
party software that is licensed under third party terms.  SOLACE may direct 
Licensee to such third party terms, and in some instances the Software cannot 
be used or further distributed without Licensee’s acceptance of such terms.  
Any failure of Licensee to agree to the terms applicable to such third party 
software may undermine certain functionality of or prevent Licensee from 
using the Software.

4.4	Open Source Software.

(a)	Licensee will not represent to third parties, or use any third party 
software or code in conjunction with: (i) the Software; or (ii) any software,

Software, in such a way that: (A) creates, purports to create or has the 
potential to create, obligations for SOLACE with respect to the Software; or 
(B) grants, purports to grant, or has the potential to grant to any third 
party any rights to or immunities under any Intellectual Property Rights of 
SOLACE, as such rights exist in or relate to the Products.

(b)	Licensee will not use any Software in any manner, including through 
incorporation, linking, distribution or otherwise, that will cause any 
Products and any Intellectual Property Rights therein to become subject to 
any encumbrance or terms and conditions of any third party or open source 
license, including any open source license listed on 
http://www.opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical (each an "Open Source 
License"). 

(c)	The restrictions, limitations, exclusions and conditions referred to 
under subsection (b) will apply even if SOLACE becomes aware of or fails to 
act in a manner to address any violation or failure to comply therewith.  No 
act by SOLACE that is undertaken under this Agreement in respect to any 
Products will be construed as intending to cause any Intellectual Property 
Rights that are owned or controlled by SOLACE or any of its affiliates (or 
for which SOLACE or any of its affiliates has received license rights) to 
become subject to any encumbrance or terms and conditions of any Open Source 
License.

4.5	Use of Name and Logo.  Licensee will not display or make any use of 
SOLACE’s or its affiliates’ names, marks or logos without the prior written 
approval of SOLACE.

5	FEES AND TAXES

5.1	Fees. Licensee shall pay the applicable Subscription Fees and support 
fees specified in the applicable Order. Except as otherwise specified herein 
or in an Order,  Subscription Fees are based on Subscriptions purchased and 
not actual usage. Payment obligations are non-cancellable, Subscription Fees 
paid are non-refundable, and the number of Subscriptions purchased cannot be 
decreased during the relevant Subscription Term.

date may accrue (except with respect to charges then subject to a reasonable 
and good faith dispute), at Licensor' discretion, late charges at the rate of

rate permitted by law, whichever is lower, from the date such payment was due 
until the date paid. 

6	CONFIDENTIALITY

6.1	Definition of Confidential Information. 

In this Agreement "Confidential Information" of a Party means any information 
of a Party (including in respect to SOLACE any of its affiliates, licensors, 
customers, employees or subcontractors) (the "Disclosing Party"), whether 
oral, written or in electronic form, which has or will come into the 
possession or knowledge of the other Party (the "Receiving Party") in 
connection with or as a result of entering into this Agreement that can 
reasonably be considered to be confidential in the circumstances of 
disclosure or which is designated as confidential. The Products, any 
performance information, service levels, support terms, and results of 
testing of the Software, and the terms of this Agreement are Confidential 
Information of SOLACE. Notwithstanding the foregoing, "Confidential 
Information" does not include information that is:

(a)	publicly available when it is received by or becomes known to the 
Receiving Party or that subsequently becomes publicly available other than 
through a direct or indirect act or omission of the Receiving Party (but only 
after it becomes publicly available); 

(b)	established by evidence to have been already known to the Receiving 
Party at the time of its disclosure to the Receiving Party and is not known 
by the Receiving Party to be the subject of an obligation of confidence of 
any kind;

(c)	independently developed by the Receiving Party without any use of or 
reference to the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party as 
established by evidence that would be acceptable to a court of competent 
jurisdiction; 

(d)	received by the Receiving Party in good faith without an obligation 
of confidence of any kind from a third party who the Receiving Party had no 
reason to believe was not lawfully in possession of such information free of 
any obligation of confidence of any kind, but only until the Receiving Party 
subsequently comes to have reason to believe that such information was 
subject to an obligation of confidence of any kind when originally received; 
or

(e)	Feedback provided by Licensee or a representative of Licensee.

6.2	Confidentiality Obligations.

(a)	Each Party will, in its capacity as a Receiving Party: (i) not use or 
reproduce Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party for any purpose, 
other than as may be reasonably necessary for the exercise of its rights or 
the performance of its obligations set out in this Agreement; and (ii) not 
disclose, provide access to, transfer or otherwise make available any 
Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to any third party except as 
expressly permitted in this Agreement.

(b)	Each Party may, in its capacity as a Receiving Party, disclose 
Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party: (i) if and to the extent 
required by a governmental authority or otherwise as required by applicable 
law, provided that the Receiving Party must first give the Disclosing Party 
notice of such compelled disclosure (except where prohibited by applicable 
law from doing so) and must use commercially reasonable efforts to provide 
the Disclosing Party with an opportunity to take such steps as it desires to 
challenge or contest such disclosure or seek a protective order.  Thereafter, 
the Receiving Party may disclose the Confidential Information of the 
Disclosing Party, but only to the extent required by applicable law and 
subject to any protective order that applies to such disclosure; and (ii) to: 
(A) its accountants, internal and external auditors and other professional 
advisors if and to the extent that such persons need to know such 
Confidential Information in order to provide the applicable professional 
advisory services relating to the Receiving Party; and (B) employees of the 
Receiving Party and its subcontractors if and to the extent that such persons 
need to know such Confidential Information to perform their respective 
obligations under this Agreement; 

provided that any such person is aware of the provisions of this Section 6.2 
and has entered into a written agreement with the Receiving Party that 
includes confidentiality obligations in respect of such Confidential 
Information of the Disclosing Party that are no less stringent than those 
contained in this Section 6.2.

6.3	Consent to Injunctive Relief.  Any unauthorized use or disclosure of 
the Confidential Information of SOLACE, its affiliates or licensors may cause 
irreparable harm and significant injury to SOLACE that would be difficult to 
ascertain or quantify; accordingly Licensee agrees that SOLACE will have the 
right to seek and obtain injunctive or other equitable relief to enforce the 
terms of this Agreement and without limiting any other rights or remedies 
that SOLACE may have.

7	WARRANTY AND DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES.

7.1	Warranty.  SOLACE warrants that the Software will materially comply 
with the Documentation during the Subscription Term.  If the Software does 
not materially conform with the warranty in the prior sentence, provided that 
Licensee is in compliance with the terms of this Agreement, and all 
Subscription Fees are fully-paid up, SOLACE will provide the support to 
Licensee in respect to the applicable Software to the extent set out in 
SOLACE’s then current Support and Maintenance Terms, and the provision of 
support to correct the non-compliance with the warranty in this Section will 
be Licensee’s sole and exclusive remedy in the event of non-compliance with 
the warranty in this Section by SOLACE.  All other support will be dependent 
on the plan procured by Licensee, as defined in the Support and Maintenance 
Terms.

7.2	Disclaimers.

a)	EXCEPT AS SET OUT IN SECTION 7.1, THE PRODUCTS AND  SUPPORT THAT MAY 
BE PROVIDED BY SOLACE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, IS PROVIDED ‘AS-IS’ AND ‘AS 
AVAILABLE’. 

(b)	Except as set out in Section 7.1, the Products and  support are 
without any additional warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, 
collateral, statutory or otherwise. SOLACE does not warrant or make any 
representations regarding the use, or the results of the use, of the Products 
in terms of its correctness, accuracy, reliability, or otherwise. 

(c)	SOLACE does not represent or warrant that the functionality of the 
Products will meet Licensee requirements, or that the operation of the 
Products will be uninterrupted or error-free, or that the Products  or any 
service enabled by the use of the Software will always be available, or that 
defects in the Products  will be corrected. 

(d)	TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, SOLACE ON ITS 
OWN BEHALF AND ON BEHALF OF ITS AFFILIATES AND LICENSOR(S) EXPRESSLY 
DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY 
OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, AND CONDITIONS OF 
MERCHANTABLE QUALITY, MERCHANTABILITY, QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR 
PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

(e)	Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, 
so exclusions in this Article 7 will apply only to the extent permitted by 
applicable law.

8	LICENSEE INDEMNITY AND EXCLUSION.

8.1	Licensee Indemnity.

(a)	Without limiting SOLACE’s rights and remedies under this Agreement, 
Licensee will indemnify, defend and hold SOLACE, its licensors, affiliates or 
any of their respective directors, officers, employees or agents (together, 
the "Solace Indemnitees") harmless from and against any and all third party 
Claims and Losses incurred or otherwise suffered by each SOLACE Indemnitee 
arising out of, resulting from or related to:
(i)	any use, reproduction or distribution of the Products 
(notwithstanding the restrictions and obligations in this Agreement), as 
modified or integrated by Licensee in Licensee application, which causes an 
infringement or misappropriation of any Intellectual Property Right, 
publicity or privacy right of any third parties arising in any jurisdiction 
anywhere in the world, except and solely to the extent such infringement is 
caused by the unmodified Software, or portions thereof, as supplied to 
Licensee by SOLACE under this Agreement; or
(ii)	any use, downloading, distribution, installation, storage, execution, 
or transfer of the Products in breach of this Agreement.

(b)	SOLACE may enforce the indemnity under this Article 8 on behalf of 
any or all of the SOLACE Indemnitees.  Licensee may only bring a Claim 
against SOLACE and not any SOLACE Indemnitees under this Agreement.

8.2	SOLACE Indemnity.

(a)	SOLACE will defend Licensee from and against any and all Claims by a 
third party incurred or otherwise suffered by Licensee arising out of, 
resulting from or related to a Claim that the Products licensed pursuant to 
Section 2.1 infringe or misappropriate third party copyright or patent rights 
in Canada or the United States of America, and indemnity Licensee from any 
damages awarded by a court of final determination.

(b)	Without limitation, Section 8.2 will not be applicable and SOLACE 
will not be liable to defend a Claim to the extent that such Claim is based 
on: (i) Licensee’s use of the Products after SOLACE notifies Licensee to 
discontinue using them; (ii) Licensee combining the Products with non-SOLACE 
services, products, programs or data; or (iii) Licensee altering or modifying 
the Products. 

(c)	If SOLACE receives information concerning an infringement or 
misappropriation Claim related to the Products, SOLACE may, at its expense 
and without obligation to do so, either: (i) procure the Intellectual 
Property Rights or other right(s) to continue to use the Product; or (ii) 
replace or modify the Product to make it non-infringing; or (iii) immediately 
terminate this Agreement on written notice to Licensee, in which case SOLACE 
will refund to Licensee, on a pro-rata basis, any pre-paid fees in respect to 
such Product from the date of such termination to the end of the then current 
Subscription Term for such Product; and this Section 8.2(c) states the sole 
and exclusive remedy of Licensee and the entire liability of SOLACE for third 
party infringement claims and actions.

8.3	Indemnification Procedures.  Each Party’s obligations under this 
Article 8 are contingent on all of the following: (i) the Party seeking the 
indemnity (the "Indemnified Party") must notify the other Party (the 
"Indemnifying Party"), in a timely manner and in writing of the Claim; (ii) 
the Indemnified Party must give the Indemnifying Party sole control over 
defense and settlement of the Claim; (iii) the Indemnified Party must provide 
the Indemnifying Party with reasonable information and assistance, at the 
Indemnifying Party’s request, as needed in defending the Claim (the 
Indemnifying Party will reimburse the Indemnified Party for reasonable 
expenses that the Indemnified Party incurs in providing that assistance).  
The Indemnified Party may choose to have its counsel, monitor or participate 
in the defense of such a Claim provided that the Indemnified Party will be 
responsible for the cost of its own counsel and the Indemnifying Party’s 
obligations in this Article 8 do not extend to the Indemnified Party’s legal 
costs should it wish to exercise such right. The Indemnifying Party will not 
be responsible for any settlement made by the Indemnified Party without its 
prior written consent.	The Indemnifying Party may not settle or publicize 
any Claim without the Indemnified Party’s prior written consent.

then-current Subscription Term. The Subscription Fees during any automatic 
renewal term will be as set forth in the applicable Order.

11	AUDIT AND REMEDIATION

11.1	Audit. During the term of this Agreement and for two years 
thereafter, SOLACE or any internal or external audit representative acting on 
behalf of SOLACE (the "SOLACE Audit Representatives") will have the right,

regular business hours and upon reasonable prior written notice to Licensee, 
to audit and inspect on a mutually agreed upon date and location any system 
or facility or part of a system or facility to which Licensee has downloaded

performance by Licensee of its obligations under this Agreement, including 
the Licensee’s usage of the Products in accordance with the restrictions and 
terms in this Agreement.

11.2	Remediation. Without limiting SOLACE’s rights and remedies under this 
Agreement, if an audit conducted pursuant to this Agreement reveals any

13	GENERAL

13.1	U.S. Government Users.	If Licensee are acting on behalf of an agency 
or instrumentality of the U.S. federal government, the Product, as 
applicable, are "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer 
software documentation" developed exclusively at private expense by SOLACE.  
Pursuant to FAR 12.212 or DFARS 227 7202 and their successors, as applicable, 
use, reproduction and disclosure of the Products is governed by the terms of 
this Agreement.

13.2	Entire Agreement. This Agreement, and the agreements and other 
documents required to be delivered pursuant to this Agreement, constitute the 
entire and exclusive agreement between SOLACE and Licensee, and sets out all 
the covenants, promises, warranties, representations, conditions and 
agreements between the Parties in connection with the subject matter of this 
Agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements (whether written or oral, 
pre-contractual or otherwise) and other communications between SOLACE and 
Licensee. There are no covenants, promises, warranties, representations, 
conditions or other agreements, whether oral or written, pre-contractual or 
otherwise, express, implied or collateral, whether statutory or otherwise, 
between the Parties in connection with the subject matter of this Agreement 
except as specifically set forth in this Agreement and any document required 
to be delivered pursuant to this Agreement.

13.3	Amendments. This Agreement may be modified only by a written 
amendment agreed to by both Licensee and SOLACE, except that SOLACE may 
modify the Documentation from time to time, provided that SOLACE does not 
materially lessen the description of the functionality of the Products as a 
result of such modification.

13.4	English Language. This Agreement is entered into solely in the 
English language, and if for any reason any other language version is 
prepared by any Party, it will be solely for convenience and the English 
version will govern and control in all respects.  If Licensee are located in 
the province of Quebec, Canada, the following applies:	The Parties hereby 
confirm they have requested this Agreement and all related documents be 
prepared in English.  Les parties ont exigé que le présent contrat et tous 
les documents connexes soient rédigés en anglais.

13.5	Waiver. To be effective, any waiver by a Party of any of its rights 
or any other Party’s obligations under this Agreement must be made in a 
writing signed by the Party to be charged with the waiver.  No failure or 
forbearance by any Party to insist upon or enforce performance by any other 
Party of any of the provisions of this Agreement or to exercise any rights or 
remedies under this Agreement or otherwise at law or in equity will be 
construed as a waiver or relinquishment to any extent of such Party’s right 
to assert or rely upon any such provision, right, or remedy in that or any 
other instance; rather, the same will be and remain in full force and effect. 
 A Party’s waiver of a breach of any term will not be a waiver of any 
subsequent breach of the same or another term.	

13.6	Cumulative Rights. The rights of each Party hereunder are cumulative 
and no exercise or enforcement by a Party of any right or remedy hereunder 
will preclude the exercise or enforcement by such Party of any other right or 
remedy hereunder or which such Party is otherwise entitled by law to enforce.

13.7	Severability.  If, in any jurisdiction, any provision of this 
Agreement or its application to any Party or circumstance is restricted, 
prohibited or unenforceable, the provision will, as to that jurisdiction, be 
ineffective only to the extent of the restriction, prohibition or 
unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions of this 
Agreement and without affecting the validity or enforceability of such 
provision in any other jurisdiction, or without affecting its application to 
other Parties or circumstances.

13.8	Assignment.  SOLACE may assign this Agreement or any of the benefits, 
rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent 
of the Licensee.  Licensee may not assign this Agreement or any of the 
benefits, rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior 
written consent of SOLACE. Any attempt by Licensee to so assign or transfer 
is null and void. If SOLACE does consent to an assignment of this Agreement, 
the transferee/assignee must be acceptable to SOLACE and agree to the terms 
and conditions of this Agreement.

13.9	Further Assurances. The Parties will, with reasonable diligence, do 
all things and provide all such reasonable assurances as may be required to 
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and each Party 
will provide such further documents or instruments required by any other 
Party as may be reasonably necessary or desirable to effect the purpose of 
this Agreement and carry out its provisions.

13.10	Governing Law and Jurisdiction.  This Agreement is governed and 
interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Province of Ontario and the 
laws of Canada applicable therein, without giving effect to its conflict of 
laws provisions. Any Claim arising out of or related to this Agreement must 
be brought exclusively in a federal or provincial court located in Ottawa, 
Canada, and Licensee hereby consents to the jurisdiction and venue of such 
courts.  Each of the Parties irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent it may 
effectively do so, the defence of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of 
such action, application or proceeding.  The Parties will not raise any 
objection to the venue of any action, application, reference or other 
proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement in the federal or 
provincial courts sitting in Ottawa, including the objection that the 
proceedings have been brought in an inconvenient forum.  A final judgment in 
any such action, application or proceeding is conclusive and may be enforced 
in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner 
specified by law.  The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the 
International Sale of Goods is expressly disclaimed and will not apply.
